# OnlineUniversity

Project: http://onlineudatabase.hopto.org:6450/

Full stack web-based relational database app created for a fictional university as part of a collaborative two-person team for a class project. Developed front-end user interface using handlebars.js templating engine with HTML/CSS, ensuring a smooth
interface for administrators. Implemented a Rest API using Node.js and Express, integrating front-end with an SQL-driven database back-end
powered by MySQL/MariaDB. Designed and normalized a schema for a relational database, which was used to implement a website with CRUD functionality. 

# The Online University Database

The Online University Database is an online university that serves 10,000 students across the world. The University has a 5:1 students to professor ratio, 2,000 professors in 10 departments teaching 4000 classes offering 100 different majors. Our web-based database management system tracks the number of students enrolled in each class by storing this information in an enrollment table. In addition, studentâ€™s majors are tracked within the student table and the professor table tracks information about the department they are associated with. This allows the university to have the most up-to-date information on classes, students, professors, departments and enrollments. This allows for the university to make informed decisions surrounding classes, which majors to offer and which professors work for which departments. This gives the university the required business intelligence to expand on popular classes, remove classes that are least popular, which majors have the most students and which departments need to hire professors.
